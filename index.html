          <h3>1. Executive Summary</h3>
          <p>
            In 2025, global green energy reached a significant milestone as
            renewables surpassed coal to become the largest source of
            electricity generation worldwide. Clean power, including renewables
            and nuclear, now generates approximately 43% of the world's
            electricity, with record solar growth being a key driver.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="data">
          <h3>2. Comparison Data</h3>
          <p>
            According to Ember's Global Electricity Review 2025, clean power
            sources reached a 40.9% share of global electricity generation in
            2024, with renewables like solar and wind overtaking hydropower.
            This review forecasts that clean power will exceed 43% of the global
            electricity mix by the first half of 2025.

          <h3>3. Regional Performance Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            In 2025, the global green energy transition shows a shift toward
            China and emerging economies, with China accounting for roughly 60%
            of global renewable capacity growth and India on track to become the
            second-largest growth market. Policy changes have significantly
            altered the United States' growth trajectory, while the European
            Union saw solar become its largest power source for the first time.

        <section id="drivers">
          <h3>4. Section Specific Drivers</h3>
          <p>
            According to Ember, key drivers of green energy demand include the
            growth of AI and data centers, increasing cooling needs due to
            extreme heatwaves, and the expansion of the "Electrotech" sector
            encompassing solar, wind, batteries, and electric vehicles. Ember
            also notes that climate-driven demand contributed to a rise in
            fossil fuel generation in 2024 because clean energy could not always
            meet sudden spikes in demand.

          <h3>5. Critical Barriers to Growth</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>Grid and Infrastructure Bottlenecks</h4>
              <p>
                The most critical barrier is the global "interconnection queue."
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Grid Congestion:</strong> Over 3,000 GW of renewable
                  projects are currently waiting for grid connections worldwide.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Expansion Needs:</strong> To meet 2030 targets, the
                  global grid must expand by roughly 2 million km annually. In
                  the U.S., 70% of energy firms cite grid limitations as their
                  primary obstacle to growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Curtailment:</strong> Due to insufficient
                  transmission, "curtailment" (wasted clean energy) is rising
                  significantly in markets like the UK, where wind curtailment
                  reached 8.5% in 2024.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Policy and Regulatory Volatility</h4>
              <p>
                Frequent shifts in government frameworks create a high-risk
                environment for long-term investment.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>U.S. Policy Shifts:</strong> New legislation in 2025
                  (such as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act") has cut U.S.
                  renewable forecasts by nearly 50% due to the early phase-out
                  of tax credits and new land-use restrictions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Permitting Delays:</strong> Lengthy siting and
                  permitting processes remain a top barrier in Europe, India,
                  and the U.S., often leading to project cancellations due to
                  community opposition or bureaucratic fragmentation.

          <h3>6. Progress towards 2030 Targets</h3>
          <p>
            In early 2026, progress toward the 2030 green energy targets
            presents a "two-speed" reality: global deployment is breaking
            records, yet national policy and infrastructure are struggling to
            keep pace with the massive scale required.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Renewable Capacity: The Tripling Goal</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Deployment Boom: Between 2023 and 2025, renewable additions
                grew by an average of 29% annually, outperforming the 21% growth
                rate originally needed. Because of this early surge, annual
                additions now only need to grow by 12% per year from 2026 to
                2030 to stay on track.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Energy Efficiency: The Doubling Goal</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Current Rate: In 2024, global energy intensity improved by only
                1%, far below the required 4% benchmark.
              </li>
              <li>
                Investment Need: To realign with 2030 targets, annual investment
                in efficiency must increase sevenfold to approximately $2.2
                trillion.
